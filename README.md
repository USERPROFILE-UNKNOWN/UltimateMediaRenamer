Its core functionalities encompass intelligent file renaming driven by embedded metadata, rule-based categorization into structured directories, efficient identification and handling of duplicate files, and robust mechanisms for undoing and restoring operations.

The architectural design of UltimateMediaRenamer demonstrates a strong emphasis on modularity and self-containment. It leverages an embedded Python environment, integrates seamlessly with various specialized external command-line tools (such as ExifTool, FFmpeg, MediaInfo, and SQLite3), and provides a highly intuitive user interface through deep integration with the Windows shell's context menus. A fundamental strength of the system lies in its sophisticated data persistence model, which employs an SQLite database to meticulously log every file manipulation. This comprehensive logging is critical for maintaining an auditable history of changes and enabling advanced recovery features. Furthermore, the application's configuration-driven approach to file organization, managed through a dedicated platforms.json file, ensures flexible and easily extensible categorization rules, allowing the system to adapt to evolving media management needs.

2. Overall System Architecture and File Structure

The architecture of UltimateMediaRenamer v1.0.0 (Stable) is structured into several top-level directories, each serving a distinct and critical role in the application's operation, deployment, and maintainability. This modular design facilitates a clear separation of concerns, enhancing the system's robustness and simplifying future development.

The directory layout is as follows:

Batch Directory: This directory contains a collection of Windows Batch scripts (.bat files). These scripts act as an essential intermediary layer, functioning as direct executables triggered by Windows context menu entries. Their primary responsibility is to establish the necessary execution environment, defining variables such as UMR_ROOT (the application's root directory), PYTHON (path to the embedded Python executable), and SCRIPT (path to the main Python script). Subsequently, they invoke the core Python application (UltimateMediaRenamer.py) with specific command-line arguments tailored to the desired operation (e.g., rename single, organize run). This abstraction significantly simplifies user interaction by integrating complex Python logic directly into the native Windows shell.   

Installer Directory: This component is central to the application's deployment. It houses the final installer executable, UltimateMediaRenamer [v1.0.0][x64]_Setup.exe, which is generated from the UltimateMediaRenamer.iss Inno Setup script. Also included is UMR_ContextMenus_256.ico, the icon utilized for both the installer interface and the context menu entries. This directory encapsulates all elements required for a streamlined and automated installation process.  

Registry Directory: This directory is dedicated to enabling deep integration with the Windows operating system. It contains .reg files, specifically UMR_ContextMenus.reg and UMR_ContextMenus_Uninstall.reg, alongside UMR_ContextMenus.ico. These files are instrumental in adding and removing application-specific options to the right-click context menus within File Explorer, thereby providing users with a direct and intuitive interface to access the program's functionalities.  

Scripts Directory: This is the intellectual core of UltimateMediaRenamer, containing the primary Python application logic. It includes UltimateMediaRenamer.py, the main script that orchestrates all file management operations, and platforms.json, a JSON-formatted configuration file that defines the rules for media categorization. This directory embodies the algorithms and business logic that drive the application's capabilities.  

Setup Directory: This directory contains essential files for the post-installation setup and ongoing dependency management. Key files include setup_installer.py, a Python script executed by the Inno Setup installer to handle tasks such as installing Python packages and external tools; requirements.txt, which lists all necessary Python package dependencies; and cacert.pem, a CA certificate bundle crucial for secure downloads during the setup process. This directory plays a vital role in ensuring the application's self-contained and functional state post-installation.  

Tools Directory: This component is critical for the application's specialized capabilities. It hosts the embedded Python runtime environment (within its Python subdirectory, containing python.exe, python311.dll, etc.) and a suite of vital external command-line utilities. These utilities include exiftool.exe, ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe, MediaInfo.exe, and sqlite3.exe. These tools are indispensable for advanced metadata extraction, media processing, and database management, underscoring the program's reliance on powerful third-party components to achieve its objectives.  

The modular separation of these components—from batch wrappers and Python logic to configuration, installation scripts, and external tools—significantly enhances the application's maintainability. This design allows for independent updates or targeted troubleshooting of specific parts without affecting the entire system. The use of an embedded Python environment and bundled external tools ensures a consistent and predictable execution environment, minimizing reliance on the user's pre-existing system configurations.

A notable architectural characteristic is the self-contained deployment strategy, which contributes significantly to the application's reliability. The inclusion of a dedicated Python runtime within the Tools\Python directory, coupled with setup_installer.py's capability to download and place essential external executables like exiftool.exe, ffmpeg.exe, MediaInfo.exe, and sqlite3.exe directly into the Tools folder, indicates a deliberate design choice. This approach contrasts sharply with applications that depend on system-wide Python installations or pre-existing external utilities. The direct consequence of this design is a substantial reduction in external environmental dependencies. This leads to a more robust and portable application for the end-user, as UltimateMediaRenamer becomes less vulnerable to conflicts with other software or variations in the user's system setup, such as differing Python versions or absent system tools. This strategy simplifies the installation experience, delivering a "just works" solution and affording the developer precise control over the versions of all dependencies, thereby preventing unforeseen compatibility issues.

Another architectural strength is the layered command execution model, which optimizes both user experience and modularity. The system employs .reg files to register context menu entries, which, upon user selection, trigger the execution of .bat files. These batch files then, in turn, execute the main UltimateMediaRenamer.py script, passing specific arguments. This three-tiered execution pathway—Registry to Batch to Python—provides a highly accessible user interface through native context menus while effectively abstracting the underlying complexity of the Python logic. The batch files serve as a critical intermediary, translating simple user clicks into structured command-line instructions for the Python script. This design enhances user accessibility by integrating seamlessly into the Windows shell, making sophisticated file operations feel intuitive. Furthermore, it promotes modularity; modifications to the core Python logic do not necessitate changes to the registry entries, only to the batch files (if argument structures are altered) or the Python script itself. This separation streamlines development and maintenance efforts.

3. Core Functionalities: Design and Implementation Deep Dive

UltimateMediaRenamer v1.0.0 (Stable) provides a suite of powerful functionalities for managing media files, each implemented with careful consideration for accuracy, user control, and data integrity.

File Renaming Mechanisms

The application offers both single and batch file renaming capabilities, driven by intelligent metadata extraction and robust conflict resolution.

Single File Renaming: The process for renaming a single file begins with the rename_file(filepath) function. Before any modification, ensure_original_logged(filepath) is invoked to record the file's initial state in the persistent operations log, ensuring its original path and name are preserved. A   

rename_plan is then formulated by create_rename_plan, which first verifies if the target is a directory (and skips it if so) or if the file is already correctly named according to the desired YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS pattern. If a valid earliest date is successfully identified, a new filename following this precise timestamp format, appended with the original file extension, is proposed.  

Batch Renaming: For processing multiple files, process_dir_for_rename(directory, recursive) is utilized. This function systematically identifies all files within a specified directory (with an option for recursive traversal) and applies the single file renaming logic (rename_file) to each, ensuring consistent and automated renaming across an entire collection of media.  

A critical aspect of the renaming process is the prioritization of metadata reliability for filename generation. The extract_all_metadata_dates(filepath) function is central to this, meticulously attempting to extract various date and time metadata from diverse sources. This includes a comprehensive range of image and video metadata fields (such as DateTimeOriginal, CreateDate, ModifyDate, XMP:CreateDate, XMP:DateCreated, XMP:ModifyDate, FileCreateDate, FileModifyDate, QuickTime:CreateDate, QuickTime:ModifyDate, ID3:Year, and ID3:Date) using the powerful ExifTool utility (exiftool.exe). For video streams,  

FFprobe (ffprobe.exe) is employed to extract the creation_time, while MediaInfo (MediaInfo.exe) retrieves the Encoded_Date from general media file information. As a robust fallback, the file's filesystem modification time (  

os.path.getmtime(filepath)) is also captured, guaranteeing that a date is almost always available for renaming purposes. The  

parse_date_string helper function then standardizes these varied date formats into datetime objects. The  

find_earliest_date(fp) function processes all successfully extracted dates and selects the chronologically earliest valid date. This earliest date is then precisely formatted as YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS to form the foundation of the new filename. This careful prioritization of the earliest available date, particularly from embedded metadata, over potentially mutable filesystem dates, reflects an understanding that filesystem timestamps can be easily altered (e.g., during copying or moving operations) and may not accurately represent the true creation or capture time of the media content. This design choice significantly enhances the accuracy and meaningfulness of the automated renaming process. By relying on intrinsic metadata, the program generates filenames that are more likely to reflect the actual moment a photo was taken or a video was recorded, which is invaluable for consistent media organization and archival, ensuring long-term integrity independent of file system events.

To prevent data loss and maintain order, UltimateMediaRenamer employs sophisticated strategies for resolving filename conflicts. The resolve_conflicts(rename_plan) function is crucial here. It actively prevents overwriting existing files or creating duplicate names within the same directory during renaming operations. The function meticulously checks for conflicts with both existing files already present on disk and other proposed renames within the current processing plan. If a conflict is detected, it intelligently appends an incremental counter (e.g., filename (2).ext) to the proposed new filename until a unique and non-conflicting name is identified. This proactive approach ensures that all files are preserved and uniquely identified.  

Intelligent File Organization

File organization is a key feature, driven by a highly configurable system.

Configuration with platforms.json: The platforms.json file serves as the central configuration repository for media categorization. It defines a structured set of rules, where each entry specifies a descriptive name (e.g., "Instagram_Videos"), a target folder path (e.g., "Instagram/Videos", "Android/Pictures/Screenshot"), and a list of filename_patterns. These patterns are regular expressions used to identify files belonging to a specific category.   

Categorization Logic: The organize_run(directory, recursive) function implements the categorization logic. It iterates through the files and matches their filenames against the predefined filename_patterns in platforms.json. The first matching pattern determines the destination folder for the file. This enables highly specific categorization based on common naming conventions originating from various devices and social media platforms (e.g., IMG_, VID_, Snapchat-, Screenshot_).  

Multi-Pass Organization: The "pass" attribute (e.g., pass: 1, pass: 2) within platforms.json indicates a multi-stage categorization strategy. Files matching pass: 1 patterns are initially sorted into broader, general categories (e.g., Snapchat/Pictures). Subsequently, pass: 2 patterns (such as those for Snapchat_Pictures_Resized or Snapchat_Pictures_Edited) allow for further refinement, moving these files into more specific subfolders (e.g., Snapchat/Pictures/Resized, Snapchat/Pictures/-edited). This hierarchical approach enables a granular and highly structured organization of media files.  

The granular and extensible organization logic facilitated by platforms.json is a significant architectural advantage. By externalizing the categorization rules into a declarative JSON file, the system achieves a high degree of flexibility. The use of regular expressions allows for complex and precise pattern matching, while the multi-pass system enables sophisticated hierarchical sorting. This design promotes extensibility and simplifies maintenance, allowing users or developers to easily add new platforms, modify existing patterns, or refine the sorting hierarchy without requiring any changes to the core Python code. This future-proofs the organization feature, enabling it to adapt seamlessly to new devices, social media platforms, or evolving user-specific naming conventions. The multi-pass system also suggests the potential for more advanced organization workflows, where files can be initially broadly categorized and then progressively refined into highly specific subfolders.

Duplicate Cleaning Process

UltimateMediaRenamer includes a dedicated function for identifying and managing duplicate files, helping users reclaim storage space and maintain organized media collections.

Duplicate Detection: The find_duplicates(directory) function is responsible for identifying redundant files. It computes a SHA1 hash (compute_hash) for the content of each file within a specified directory. Files that yield identical SHA1 hashes are then flagged as duplicates, providing a content-based, rather than name-based, identification of redundancy.   

Duplicate Handling: Once duplicates are identified, select_best(paths) determines which file among a set of duplicates should be retained. The selection criteria prioritize files with larger sizes, followed by those without an appended counter (e.g., filename (2).ext), suggesting a preference for the "original" or primary copy. The remaining duplicate files (those not selected for retention) are then moved by move_duplicates(dupes, target_dir) to a designated Doubles subdirectory within the specified target location. To prevent naming conflicts within the Doubles directory, the system appends _ (dupX) (e.g., filename_ (dup1).ext) to the filenames of moved duplicates, ensuring each file remains uniquely identifiable.  

Undo and Restore Operations

A critical aspect of any file management utility is the ability to revert unintended changes. UltimateMediaRenamer provides robust undo and restore functionalities, backed by its comprehensive logging system.

Undo Last Operation: The undo_last_rename(target) function facilitates the reversal of the most recent file operation. It queries the operations_log to identify the last rename, categorize, or duplicate_clean action performed on a given file. Upon identification, it executes the inverse file system operation (e.g., os.rename(newp, orig) for renames or shutil.move(newp, orig) for moves) to revert the file to its previous state.   

Restore Original State: The restore_original(target, full_history=True) function (and its directory counterpart, restore_locations) offers a powerful recovery mechanism. It meticulously traces a file's entire history within the operations_log to pinpoint its true_original_path—the absolute path where the file was first encountered by the application. The file is then moved from its current location back to this initial, original path, enabling recovery even after multiple, complex operations involving renaming, categorization, or duplicate cleaning.  

The implementation of robust conflict resolution and data integrity measures across file operations is a cornerstone of UltimateMediaRenamer's design. The explicit handling of naming collisions by resolve_conflicts during renaming and get_unique_filename during organization and duplicate cleaning, through the appending of counters or _ (dupX) suffixes, directly prevents data loss from accidental overwrites. Furthermore, the strategic use of file hashing—SHA256 for logging rename operations (compute_file_hash) and SHA1 for duplicate detection (compute_hash)—provides content-based identifiers. This ensures that even if filenames change, the original file's content can be verified or accurately identified as a duplicate. This demonstrates a profound commitment to data integrity and user safety. The program is inherently designed to be non-destructive, minimizing the risk of accidental data loss, which is paramount for any reliable file management utility. The hashing capabilities also facilitate dependable duplicate detection, contributing to efficient storage management and data deduplication efforts.

4. Data Persistence and Comprehensive Logging

UltimateMediaRenamer v1.0.0 (Stable) employs a sophisticated data persistence and logging mechanism centered around an SQLite database, specifically through its operations_log table. This design ensures that a detailed and auditable record of all file manipulations is maintained, which is critical for the application's robust undo and restore functionalities.

operations_log Database Analysis

The SQLite database, UltimateMediaRenamer.db, is located within the Database subdirectory of the application's base directory. The initialize_database() function ensures that the operations_log table is created upon the first run if it does not already exist, establishing a persistent record-keeping system.  

The operations_log table is meticulously structured to capture comprehensive details about each file operation. Its schema is designed to provide a rich historical context for every modification:

-Primary key, auto-incrementing, uniquely identifies each log entry.
-Stores the file's absolute path before the operation was performed.
-Stores the file's absolute path after the operation was performed.
-Describes the type of action executed (e.g., 'first_seen', 'rename', 'categorize', 'duplicate_clean', 'undo', 'restore').
-Records the specific platform or category identified for the file during organization (e.g., 'Instagram_Videos', 'Facebook_Pictures', 'Duplicates').
-The exact date and time the operation was logged, formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS".
-A crucial field that stores the absolute original path of a file when it was first encountered by the system. This field is designed to remain constant and is never overwritten, providing a reliable anchor for restoring files to their initial location across multiple operations.
-Used specifically within duplicate cleaning operations to link related moves or deletions within a chain of duplicate handling, allowing for grouped traceability.
-The filename before the operation.
-The filename after the operation.
-The earliest chronological date extracted from the file's various metadata fields (e.g., creation date, modification date, EXIF data).
-Date extracted specifically from EXIF metadata.
-Date extracted specifically from XMP metadata.
-Date extracted using FFprobe, primarily for media files.	
-A fallback date, typically the filesystem modification time, used when other metadata dates are unavailable.	
-SHA256 hash of the file's content. This hash is used for identifying duplicates and verifying file integrity, ensuring that the content's identity is preserved even if its name or location changes.
-Logging Mechanisms and Significance for File History

Each type of file operation triggers a specific logging event in the operations_log table, providing a comprehensive audit trail:

first_seen Operation (Initial Logging):

Trigger: The ensure_original_logged(filepath) function is invoked proactively before almost any file operation (including rename, undo, restore, organize, or duplicate clean).   

Information Logged: This entry records the file's initial state, setting both original_path and new_path to the current filepath. The operation is marked as "first_seen," along with a timestamp, the true_original_path (which is also the current filepath at this point), and the original_name (the basename of the filepath).  

Significance: This foundational entry is crucial for historical tracking. It ensures that the very first known path and name of a file are permanently recorded and are never overwritten. This true_original_path field is indispensable for restore operations, enabling files to be accurately moved back to their absolute initial location, even after undergoing multiple subsequent renames or reorganizations.  

rename Operation (Single and Batch):

Trigger: Logged whenever a file is renamed by either the rename_file or process_dir_for_rename functions.   

Information Logged: This entry captures the transformation, including the original_path (the old path) and new_path (the new path). The operation is "rename," accompanied by a timestamp, the original_name (old filename), and the new_name (new filename). Crucially, it also records the earliest_metadata_date, exif_date, xmp_date, ffprobe_date, mediainfo_date, fallback_date, and the file_hash. The true_original_path for this entry is set to the original_path of this specific rename operation, maintaining a link back to the initial "first_seen" record.  

Significance: This detailed logging captures the precise transformation of a file's name and its associated metadata at the moment of renaming. The file_hash ensures that the content's identity remains verifiable even as its name changes. The consistent linking via true_original_path helps maintain a complete chain of custody for the file's history.  

categorize Operation (Organize File/Files):

Trigger: Occurs when a file is moved to an "Organized" subfolder based on its filename patterns by the organize_run function.   

Information Logged: This entry includes the original_path (path before the move), new_path (path after the move), operation as "categorize," a timestamp, and the platform_detected (e.g., 'Instagram/Videos'). Importantly, the true_original_path is retrieved from the log to ensure that the file's original, pre-categorization path is preserved.  

Significance: This tracks the structural reorganization of files within the user's media collection. By logging platform_detected, it explicitly records the rule or reason why a file was moved to a specific category. The true_original_path is vital for the restore-dir functionality, enabling files to be accurately moved back to their original directory before any organization took place.  

duplicate_clean Operation (Find Duplicates):

Trigger: Logged when duplicate files are identified and subsequently moved to a designated 'Doubles' directory by the move_duplicates function.   

Information Logged: This entry records the original_path (path of the duplicate file before the move) and new_path (path after the move to 'Doubles'). The operation is "duplicate_clean," with platform_detected set to 'Duplicates,' a timestamp, the true_original_path (the original path of the duplicate), and a move_chain_id (a unique identifier linking all operations related to a specific set of duplicates). It also includes the original_name, new_name, and file_hash.  

Significance: This provides a clear and auditable record for duplicate removal actions. The file_hash confirms that the files were indeed duplicates, and the move_chain_id allows for grouping related duplicate operations, which can be beneficial for more complex undo/restore scenarios or for auditing deduplication efforts.  

undo Operation (Undo Last Rename/Batch Rename):

Trigger: Initiated when undo_last_rename or process_dir_undo is executed.   

Information Logged: This entry records the original_path (which corresponds to the new_path of the preceding operation) and the new_path (which corresponds to the original_path of the preceding operation). The operation is explicitly marked as "undo".  

Significance: This explicitly records the reversal of the last file modification, providing a clear step-by-step history of changes. It enables the system to reliably trace back and reverse previous alterations.  

restore Operation (Restore Original Filename/File Locations):

Trigger: Occurs when restore_original or process_dir_restore is executed.   

Information Logged: This entry includes the original_path (the current path of the file) and the new_path (which is the first_orig path derived from the file's history). The operation is "restore," and the true_original_path is explicitly set to this first_orig path.  

Significance: This logs a powerful recovery mechanism. By traversing the operations_log history, the system identifies the file's absolute original path and moves it back, ensuring that even restoration actions are part of the traceable history.  

The foundational role of comprehensive logging for system reliability and recovery is evident throughout UltimateMediaRenamer. The meticulous design of the operations_log table and the consistent logging of every file modification provide a robust and detailed audit trail. This extensive record-keeping, encompassing original and new paths, operation types, timestamps, detected platforms, various metadata dates, and file hashes, is fundamental to enabling the application's accurate undo, restore, and duplicate cleaning functionalities. The ability to precisely track and revert changes to media files, even after multiple transformations, significantly enhances user confidence and the overall reliability of the system. This detailed historical data also provides valuable diagnostic information, should any unexpected behavior occur.

5. Windows Operating System Integration

UltimateMediaRenamer v1.0.0 (Stable) achieves deep and intuitive integration with the Windows operating system through a combination of Windows Registry modifications and batch scripting. This approach allows users to trigger complex file management operations directly from File Explorer's context menus.

The integration strategy is primarily driven by the .reg files located in the Registry directory, which modify the Windows Registry to add custom context menu entries. These entries appear when a user right-clicks on files, the background of a directory, or specific folders.

File Context Menus (UMR [1.x -...]): Registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\*\shell\ are responsible for adding context menu options that appear when a user right-clicks on any file. Each operation (e.g., "UMR", "UMR") has its own subkey. The Icon value points to "\\Registry\\UMR_ContextMenus.ico", providing a custom visual identifier. Crucially, the command subkey specifies the command to execute: "\\Batch\\UMR.bat\" \"%1\"". Here, "%1" is a Windows placeholder that automatically expands to the full path of the selected file, enabling the batch script to operate on that specific item.   

Background Context Menus (UMR [2.x -...]): Entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\Background\shell\ add options that appear when a user right-clicks on the background area of a directory (not on a specific file or subfolder). These are designed for batch operations affecting all files within the current directory. The command for these entries uses "%V" (e.g., "\\Batch\\UMR.bat\" \"%V\""), where "%V" represents the path of the current directory.  

Folder Context Menus (UMR [3.x -...]): Registry entries under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Directory\shell\ add options that appear when a user right-clicks directly on a folder icon. These also facilitate batch operations, but specifically target the selected folder. The command uses "%1" (e.g., "\\Batch\\UMR.bat\" \"%1\""), where "%1" here represents the path of the selected folder.  

The UMR_ContextMenus_Uninstall.reg file is provided for clean uninstallation, containing negative entries that remove all corresponding context menu keys from the registry.  

The .bat files in the Batch directory serve as lightweight wrappers that bridge the gap between the Windows shell and the core Python application. Each .bat file is configured to execute the main Python script (UltimateMediaRenamer.py) with specific arguments relevant to the desired operation. For instance, a typical batch file sets environment variables like UMR_ROOT (derived from the batch file's own path to locate the application's root), PYTHON (pointing to the embedded python.exe), and SCRIPT (pointing to UltimateMediaRenamer.py). It then executes a command like "%PYTHON%" "%SCRIPT%" rename single "%~1", where "%~1" (or "%~V") passes the file or directory path provided by the Windows shell to the Python script.  

This layered integration strategy results in a seamless user experience through native shell integration. By embedding application functionalities directly into the Windows context menus, UltimateMediaRenamer makes complex file management operations feel intuitive and readily accessible. Users can perform tasks like renaming, organizing, or finding duplicates with a simple right-click, eliminating the need to open a separate application interface or navigate command-line arguments manually. This deep integration significantly enhances the usability and efficiency of the application for its target audience, making it a natural extension of the operating system's file management capabilities.

6. Installation Process and Dependency Management

The installation of UltimateMediaRenamer v1.0.0 (Stable) is a multi-stage, automated process orchestrated by an Inno Setup installer and a Python-based setup script. This design ensures that all necessary components, dependencies, and system integrations are correctly configured, providing a self-contained and functional application environment.

The installation begins with the Inno Setup installer (UltimateMediaRenamer.iss), which is compiled into UltimateMediaRenamer [v1.0.0][x64]_Setup.exe. This installer handles the initial deployment of files:

It defines the application's metadata (name, version, publisher) and sets the default installation directory to {userappdata}\UltimateMediaRenamer.

The installer copies all core application files from the build environment to the target installation directory. This includes batch scripts, Python scripts (including UltimateMediaRenamer.py and platforms.json), registry files, the embedded Python runtime, and critical setup files like setup_installer.py, requirements.txt, and cacert.pem.   

A registry value (HKCU\Software\UltimateMediaRenamer\Installed = "1") is set to mark the installation, facilitating future upgrade checks.  

After file copying, a PowerShell command is executed to force Windows Explorer to reload user environment variables, ensuring immediate recognition of any PATH changes.  

Following the initial file deployment, the Inno Setup script's CurStepChanged function triggers post-installation actions:

Registry File Modification: The ModifyRegistryFile() procedure reads UMR_ContextMenus.reg, replaces the `` placeholder with the actual installation path, and saves the modified file. This ensures that context menu entries correctly point to the installed batch scripts.   

Context Menu Application: The installer then silently imports the modified UMR_ContextMenus.reg file into the Windows Registry using regedit.exe, adding the application's context menu options to File Explorer.  

Python Bootstrap Execution: Crucially, the RunPythonBootstrap() procedure is invoked, executing the setup_installer.py script using the embedded Python interpreter. This command is run hidden (SW_HIDE) and waits for completion (ewWaitUntilTerminated).  

The setup_installer.py script then takes over, managing the remaining setup and dependency installation phases:

Environment Setup: It ensures necessary application directories (APP_BASE, TEMP_DIR, TOOLS_DIR, LOG_DIR) are created within the user's APPDATA folder and sets the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable to point to the bundled cacert.pem for secure downloads.   

Installation Phases: The script proceeds through a defined sequence of installations:

Install Pip: Downloads get-pip.py and executes it with the embedded Python interpreter to install pip, Python's package manager.   

Install Requirements: Uses the newly installed pip to install all Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt (e.g., argparse, sqlite3, pathlib) into the embedded Python environment.  

Install External Tools: For each external tool (ExifTool, FFmpeg, MediaInfo, SQLite3), the script performs the following:

It dynamically identifies the latest stable download link by scraping the respective official websites (e.g., exiftool.org, github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg, mediaarea.net, sqlite.org).   

The tool's zip archive is downloaded to a temporary directory.

The archive is extracted, and the relevant executable(s) (e.g., exiftool.exe, ffmpeg.exe, ffprobe.exe, MediaInfo.exe, sqlite3.exe) are moved to the application's Tools directory.  

Temporary download and extraction files are cleaned up.  

Update PATH: The add_to_path function appends the TOOLS_DIR and PYTHON_DIR to the user's system PATH environment variable using setx PATH. This makes the executables within these directories directly accessible from the command line without requiring their full path.  

Final Cleanup: After all phases are complete, the temporary directory (TEMP_DIR) is removed.  

This comprehensive process highlights the automated and robust dependency management for operational consistency. By programmatically downloading and installing specific versions of external tools and Python packages into a dedicated, embedded environment, UltimateMediaRenamer mitigates common deployment challenges such as missing dependencies, version conflicts, or system-wide PATH issues. This ensures that the application operates in a stable and predictable environment, independent of the user's existing software configurations. This approach significantly enhances the reliability and portability of the software, making it a truly self-contained solution that functions consistently across diverse Windows systems.
